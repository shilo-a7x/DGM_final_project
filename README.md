# DGM final project
Final project in Deep Generative Models course at BIU.

# VAE with GMM Clustering

This project trains a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on MNIST and clusters the latent space using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).  
The VAE and GMM are trained mutually in iterations: the VAE learns better representations, and the GMM clusters the latent space to guide the VAE.
